Carpets walls and public areas all felt dated and in need of refurbishment. Was perhaps a 4 star hotel once but not anymore. 
On a main street so can hear the traffic booked double room but bed was 2 single beds pushed together. 
The carpet in the lobby and elevator appeared to be dirty all the time. Location good close to le Marais and 3e arrondissement. Fitness room not great but adequate.
Comfortable beds welcoming staff cleanliness was very good. The breakfast time interval excellent. The room we stay in was fantastic I wasn t expecting that at all. 
For once I got the view and balcony to remember especially on my birthday. I truly enjoyed the staff welcoming and how helpful they were. 
I have been here at the Crown Plaza more then once and always keep coming back.
